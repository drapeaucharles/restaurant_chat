# Environment Variables for Optimized RAG

Add these to Railway:

RAG_MODE=optimized

This will enable the token-optimized version that:
- Uses only 3 most relevant items instead of all items
- Sends compact prompts to reduce MIA network costs
- Maintains accuracy while using ~50% fewer tokens
- Perfect for your decentralized GPU network

Other RAG_MODE options:
- RAG_MODE=improved  (balanced approach)
- RAG_MODE=full      (maximum context, highest token usage)

Current settings you should have:
USE_RAG=true
USE_LIGHTWEIGHT_EMBEDDINGS=true
RAG_MODE=optimized
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-huggingface-api-key-here
