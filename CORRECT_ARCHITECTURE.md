# Correct MIA Architecture

## Current Setup (CORRECT)

### Railway Server (Centralized)
- ✅ Stores all business data
- ✅ Manages embeddings locally
- ✅ PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Routes chat requests
- ✅ Sends prompts to GPUs for AI responses

### Decentralized GPUs
- ✅ Run MIA language models
- ✅ Process chat prompts
- ✅ Return AI-generated responses
- ❌ Should NOT handle embeddings

## The Embedding Problem

Currently on Railway:
- ML libraries not available (too large)
- Text search fallback is working
- This is actually fine for now!

## Solutions (In Order of Preference)

### 1. Use OpenAI Embeddings API (RECOMMENDED)
```python
# Simple, works immediately
import openai

def create_embedding(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        model="text-embedding-ada-002",
        input=text
    )
    return response['data'][0]['embedding']
```
- Pros: Works immediately, high quality
- Cons: Small API cost

### 2. Pre-compute Embeddings Locally
```bash
# On your local machine with GPU
python generate_embeddings_local.py
# Uploads to PostgreSQL
```
- Pros: Free, full control
- Cons: Manual process for new products

### 3. Lightweight Embeddings on Railway
```python
# Use TF-IDF or simpler models
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=384)
```
- Pros: Runs on Railway, no GPU needed
- Cons: Lower quality

## Current Status

What we have now is actually good:
1. **Text search works** for finding products
2. **Memory works** for conversation
3. **GPUs handle AI chat** (their proper role)

## Do NOT Change

- Don't move embeddings to decentralized GPUs
- Don't trust GPUs with business data
- Keep GPUs focused on MIA language model only
