# AI Hallucination Fix Summary

## Problem
The AI was hallucinating menu items that don't exist in the database. For example:
- When asked about pasta, it mentioned "Caesar Salad" 
- It invented prices in euros when all prices are in USD
- It created non-existent variations of menu items

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Response Validator Service (`services/response_validator.py`)
- Extracts all menu items mentioned in AI responses
- Validates each item against the actual database
- Detects hallucinated items and provides corrections
- Creates validated context with only real menu items

### 2. Stricter RAG Prompts
Updated the system prompts with CRITICAL RULES:
```
1. ONLY mention items that are listed in the menu context below
2. NEVER invent, guess, or add items not explicitly shown
3. Use exact names and prices from the context
4. If asked about items not in context, say they're not available
```

### 3. Category-Based Filtering
Enhanced the embedding search to:
- Detect category-specific queries (pasta, pizza, salad, etc.)
- Filter database results by category before semantic search
- Boost similarity scores for category matches
- Prevent cross-category contamination

### 4. Post-Response Validation
- After AI generates response, validate it for hallucinations
- If hallucinations detected, retry with stricter prompt
- Log any persistent hallucinations for monitoring

### 5. Validated Context Building
The `create_validated_context` method:
- Only includes items that exist in the database
- Uses exact names and prices from database
- Adds warning to AI: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: Only mention items listed above"

## Testing

Created `test_no_hallucination.py` to verify:
- Pasta queries don't return salads
- Prices are accurate (no euros)
- Non-existent items are handled properly
- Category filtering works correctly

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: AI only mentions real menu items
2. **Trust**: Customers get reliable information
3. **Scalability**: Works across different business types
4. **Cost**: No additional API calls needed

## Deployment

Simply push the changes and Railway will deploy automatically. No environment variable changes needed.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor logs for any validation failures
2. Fine-tune similarity thresholds if needed
3. Add more category keywords as menu expands
