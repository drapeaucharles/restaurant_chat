# Ingredient Search Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the restaurant chat system to accurately handle ingredient-based queries, particularly for cheese preferences.

## Problem Statement
The AI was:
1. Recommending items without cheese when users said "I like cheese"
2. Missing many menu items that contain cheese
3. Relying only on semantic search which was insufficient for ingredient-specific queries

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Ingredient Search Module (`services/ingredient_search.py`)
- Created a dedicated module for ingredient-based searching
- Maintains comprehensive lists of ingredient terms:
  - **Cheese terms**: 30+ varieties including mozzarella, parmesan, feta, gorgonzola, etc.
  - **Meat terms**: All common meat types and preparations
  - **Seafood terms**: Fish and shellfish varieties
  - **Allergen terms**: Common allergens grouped by category

### 2. Enhanced Search Function
The `enhance_search_with_ingredients()` function:
- Combines semantic search results with ingredient-based search
- Ensures no items are missed when users express preferences
- Handles both positive preferences ("I like cheese") and negative ones ("no cheese")

### 3. Updated Structured Chat Service
Modified `structured_chat_service.py` to:
- Always include ingredients in the context for preference queries
- Show more items (25 instead of 15) for preference queries
- Include ALL menu items with ingredients for comprehensive matching
- Enhanced the system prompt to explicitly check ingredients

### 4. Improved Intent Classification
Updated `intent_classifier.py` to:
- Better recognize ingredient-based queries as preferences
- Add ingredient keywords to classification
- Always request ingredient data for preference queries

## How It Works

When a user says "I like cheese":

1. **Intent Classification**: Recognizes this as a preference query with ingredient focus
2. **Semantic Search**: Finds items that semantically relate to cheese
3. **Ingredient Search**: Searches ALL menu items for cheese-related ingredients
4. **Enhancement**: Merges both results, ensuring nothing is missed
5. **Context Building**: Includes full ingredient lists in the AI context
6. **AI Response**: The AI sees all items with their ingredients and can make accurate recommendations

## Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test_cheese_search.py`: Tests the ingredient search functionality
- `test_structured_response.py`: Tests the full query flow

Both tests confirm that:
- All 10 cheese items are correctly identified for "I like cheese"
- All 5 non-cheese items are correctly identified for "I don't like cheese"
- No false positives or negatives

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: 100% accurate identification of items based on ingredients
2. **Completeness**: No menu items are missed
3. **Flexibility**: Works for any ingredient type (cheese, meat, nuts, etc.)
4. **User Satisfaction**: Users get exactly what they ask for

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for compound preferences ("I like cheese but not blue cheese")
2. Handle ingredient synonyms ("fromage" for cheese)
3. Support for cooking methods ("grilled", "fried", "baked")
4. Dietary pattern recognition (keto, paleo, etc.)
