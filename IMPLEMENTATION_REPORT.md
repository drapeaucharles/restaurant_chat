# FastAPI Restaurant Management API - Enhanced Version

## Summary of New Features

This document outlines all the new features and improvements made to the FastAPI project to implement full CRUD operations for restaurants and comprehensive client & chat management.

## ✅ **New Features Implemented**

### 1. **Full Restaurant CRUD Operations**

#### Enhanced Restaurant Routes (`/restaurant/`)
- **GET /restaurant/profile** (Protected) - Returns current restaurant's profile information
- **PUT /restaurant/profile** (Protected) - Updates current restaurant's data with new values
- **DELETE /restaurant/delete** (Protected) - Deletes the current restaurant from database

#### Key Features:
- All routes use JWT authentication to identify the current restaurant
- PUT operation completely overwrites restaurant data with new values
- DELETE operation performs hard delete for now (can be enhanced to soft delete later)
- Proper error handling and validation

### 2. **Client Management System**

#### New Client Routes (`/clients/`)
- **POST /clients/** - Creates a new client for a restaurant
- **GET /clients/** (Protected) - Returns all clients for the current authenticated restaurant

#### Client Data Model:
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `restaurant_id` - Links client to specific restaurant
- `name` - Client's name (required)
- `email` - Client's email (optional, validated)
- `preferences` - JSON object for client preferences
- `first_seen` / `last_seen` - Automatic timestamps

#### Key Features:
- Email validation using Pydantic EmailStr
- Restaurant ownership verification
- Automatic timestamp management
- Flexible preferences storage

### 3. **Chat Management System**

#### New Chat Routes (`/chat/`)
- **POST /chat/** - Stores new chat messages between clients and restaurants
- **GET /chat/** - Retrieves all chat messages between a specific client and restaurant

#### Chat Message Data Model:
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `restaurant_id` - Restaurant identifier
- `client_id` - Client UUID
- `sender_type` - Either 'client' or 'restaurant'
- `message` - Text content of the message
- `timestamp` - Automatic timestamp

#### Key Features:
- Bidirectional messaging (client ↔ restaurant)
- Messages ordered by timestamp
- Relationship validation (client must belong to restaurant)
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### Database Models (`models.py`)
Enhanced existing models and added new ones:

```python
# Enhanced Client model
class Client(Base):
    __tablename__ = "clients"
    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    restaurant_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("restaurants.restaurant_id"))
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)
    preferences = Column(JSON)
    first_seen = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
    last_seen = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=func.now())

# New ChatMessage model
class ChatMessage(Base):
    __tablename__ = "chat_messages"
    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    restaurant_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("restaurants.restaurant_id"))
    client_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("clients.id"))
    sender_type = Column(String)  # 'client' or 'restaurant'
    message = Column(Text)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
```

### Pydantic Schemas
Created comprehensive schemas for validation:

#### Client Schemas (`schemas/client.py`)
- `ClientCreateRequest` - For creating new clients
- `ClientResponse` - For API responses with proper serialization

#### Chat Schemas (`schemas/chat.py`)
- `ChatMessageCreate` - For creating new messages
- `ChatMessageResponse` - For API responses with timestamp formatting

### Route Organization
Maintained modular structure with new route files:

- `routes/clients.py` - Client management endpoints
- `routes/chats.py` - Chat management endpoints
- Enhanced `routes/restaurant.py` - Added PUT and DELETE operations

## 🔐 **Security & Authentication**

### Protected Endpoints
All sensitive operations require JWT authentication:
- Restaurant profile operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Client listing (GET /clients/)
- Chat log access (existing functionality)

### Data Validation
- Email validation using Pydantic EmailStr
- UUID validation for client IDs
- Restaurant-client relationship verification
- Sender type validation ('client' or 'restaurant')

## 📋 **API Endpoints Summary**

### Restaurant CRUD
```
GET    /restaurant/profile     # Get current restaurant profile (Protected)
PUT    /restaurant/profile     # Update restaurant profile (Protected)
DELETE /restaurant/delete      # Delete restaurant (Protected)
```

### Client Management
```
POST   /clients/               # Create new client
GET    /clients/               # List restaurant's clients (Protected)
```

### Chat Management
```
POST   /chat/                  # Send chat message
GET    /chat/                  # Get chat history
```

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Database models created and enhanced
- ✅ Pydantic schemas implemented
- ✅ Route handlers implemented
- ✅ JWT authentication integrated
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ⚠️ Route registration needs verification
- ⚠️ End-to-end testing in progress

### Known Issues
- New routes may not be properly registered in main application
- Need to verify all endpoints are accessible
- Database table creation needs verification

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### Creating a Client
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/clients/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "restaurant_id": "my_restaurant",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "preferences": {"dietary": "vegetarian"}
     }'
```

### Sending a Chat Message
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "restaurant_id": "my_restaurant",
       "client_id": "client-uuid-here",
       "sender_type": "client",
       "message": "Hello, I would like to make a reservation"
     }'
```

### Updating Restaurant Profile
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/restaurant/profile" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Updated Restaurant Name",
       "story": "Our updated story",
       "menu": [...],
       "faq": [...]
     }'
```

## 📦 **Dependencies Added**
- `pydantic[email]` - For email validation
- `email-validator` - Email validation backend
- `dnspython` - DNS resolution for email validation

## 🔄 **Next Steps**
1. Verify route registration in main application
2. Complete end-to-end testing
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement soft delete for restaurants
5. Add pagination for client and chat listings
6. Add search and filtering capabilities

The implementation provides a solid foundation for a restaurant chatbot SaaS platform with proper authentication, data validation, and modular architecture.
