## Benefits of Clear Separation

1. **AI Understanding**: The AI clearly knows what is context vs. what is the actual conversation
2. **No Confusion**: Clear markers prevent the AI from treating context as part of the dialogue
3. **Better Responses**: The AI can reference the context without repeating it verbatim
4. **Structured Information**: Different types of context (menu, dietary, history) are clearly labeled
