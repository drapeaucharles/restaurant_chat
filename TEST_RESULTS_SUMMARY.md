# Tool Calling Test Results for Bella Vista

## Summary
The tool calling implementation is complete and working, but MIA is not generating tool calls in the expected format.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Service Integration**: Full menu with tools service is properly integrated
2. **Query Detection**: System correctly identifies queries that need tools
3. **Fallback**: Service correctly falls back to full_menu on errors
4. **Client Creation**: Properly creates clients before saving messages
5. **Feature Flag**: ENABLE_FULL_MENU_TOOLS environment variable works

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue:
- MIA is receiving the tools but not generating proper tool calls
- Instead of `<tool_call>` format, MIA just mentions it would use tools and hallucinates responses
- Example: "I will use the get_dish_details tool... The Lobster Ravioli is made with..."

### üìä Test Output:
```
Query: Tell me more about the Lobster Ravioli please
Response: The Lobster Ravioli is a delightful culinary creation...
[MIA mentions using tools but doesn't actually generate tool call syntax]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The miner expects this format:
```xml
<tool_call>
{"name": "get_dish_details", "parameters": {"dish_name": "Lobster Ravioli"}}
</tool_call>
```

But MIA is generating natural language responses instead.

## Possible Solutions

1. **Check Miner Version**: Ensure miner ID 23 has the latest tool-calling code
2. **Adjust Prompt**: May need different instructions to trigger tool syntax
3. **Update Response Parser**: Handle alternative tool call formats

## Next Steps

1. Verify miner has tool support enabled
2. Test with different prompt formats
3. Consider updating response parsing to handle MIA's current format

## Current Status
- Implementation: ‚úÖ Complete
- Integration: ‚úÖ Complete  
- Tool Execution: ‚úÖ Ready
- MIA Compatibility: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs adjustment

The service is ready to use once the tool call format issue is resolved.
