### Database Changes

   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rag_mode VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'hybrid_smart';
   ```

   rag_mode = Column(String, nullable=True, default="hybrid_smart")
   ```

### API Endpoints

1. **Get Current Mode**:
   ```
   GET /restaurant/profile
   Response includes: { ..., "rag_mode": "hybrid_smart" }
   ```

2. **Update Mode**:
   ```
   PUT /restaurant/profile
   Body: { ..., "rag_mode": "enhanced_v3" }
   ```

### Frontend Integration

The owner dashboard now includes a visual RAG mode selector with:
- Clear mode descriptions
- Benefits for each mode
- Visual indicators (icons and colors)
- Real-time updates

### Dynamic Chat Routing

The new `/chat` endpoint (`chat_dynamic.py`) automatically:
1. Checks the restaurant's preferred RAG mode
2. Routes to the appropriate service
3. Falls back to hybrid_smart if mode unavailable
4. Logs which mode was used
