# Deploy DB Query Service

## Quick Deployment Steps

After pulling the latest code on your production server:

### 1. Update All Businesses to DB Query Mode

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the migration to update all businesses
python update_all_to_db_query.py
```

### 2. Verify Services Are Loaded

Check that the new services are available:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/provider | jq .
```

You should see `"db_query"` in the available_modes list.

### 3. Test a Business

Test with any business:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "restaurant_id": "bella_vista_restaurant",
    "client_id": "test-client-001",
    "sender_type": "client",
    "message": "I like tomato"
  }'
```

### 4. Monitor Performance

The new db_query service should:
- Respond in 9-12 seconds (down from 15-22s)
- Use 77% less context
- Handle ingredient searches intelligently

### What's New

1. **db_query service** - Fetches only needed menu data
2. **Fast polling** - Optimized MIA response checking
3. **MIA pre-warming** - Keeps model hot on startup
4. **Smart features**:
   - "I like tomato" → finds tomato dishes
   - "What do you suggest?" → recommendations
   - "Do you have pasta?" → finds all pasta

### Rollback (if needed)

To rollback to previous mode:
```sql
UPDATE businesses SET rag_mode = 'memory_universal';
UPDATE restaurants SET rag_mode = 'full_menu';
```

### Benefits

- **Faster responses**: 9-12s instead of 15-22s
- **Smarter AI**: Only gets relevant data
- **Better scaling**: Less data = lower costs
- **Improved accuracy**: Focused context
