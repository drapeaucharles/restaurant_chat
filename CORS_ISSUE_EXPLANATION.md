# CORS Issue Explanation

## The Error
```
Access to fetch at 'https://restaurantchat-production.up.railway.app/restaurant/info?restaurant_id=bella_vista_restaurant' 
from origin 'https://restaurantfront-production.up.railway.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## What's Actually Happening

1. **CORS is configured correctly** in the backend:
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["https://restaurantfront-production.up.railway.app"],
       allow_credentials=True,
       allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
       allow_headers=["*"]
   )
   ```

2. **The real issue**: The backend is returning 502 errors (Application failed to respond)

3. **Why CORS error appears**: When Railway returns a 502 error, it doesn't include CORS headers, so the browser reports it as a CORS issue

## The Real Problem

The restaurant backend is failing to start properly on Railway, causing:
- 502 Bad Gateway errors
- No CORS headers on error responses
- Frontend shows CORS errors (misleading)

## Solutions

1. **Fix the backend deployment issue** (what we're working on)
2. Once backend is running, CORS will work properly

## Current Status

- Added debug endpoints to help identify the issue
- Simplified code that might cause startup problems
- Waiting for deployment to complete

## Note

This is NOT a CORS configuration issue - it's a deployment/startup issue that manifests as a CORS error in the browser.
